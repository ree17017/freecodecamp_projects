        Creating your first character shiould be fun and exciting. Don't stress
        if it perfect or not this will not be the only character you build.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pick a name and maybe write a background for your caracter. Keep your
        background to a few pages unless you have RPGed this out with your DM.

      <header id="race_selection">Race Selection</header>
      <p>
        Read though each race description and pick something that sounds like
        you. It is better to start with something you like or know and then
        build into more difficult races as you gain more skill.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be a lot of fun to pick a non-standard race. Word of advice. If
        this is your first character pick a main line race.

      <p>
        Class selection can be hard and intimidating chore. I would stick to a
        melee class or cleric as my first time class. Spell casters like the
        Wizard are fun classes but take a little bit of a learning curve. If you
        like to learn more about your class than others have to then you could
        play a wizard or sorcerer.
      </p>
      <code>if(fun){ pickclass() }</code>
      <p>
        Fighter, Barb, Rogue, and Ranger are some of the easiest classes to
        start playing. Bash down the door and attack the closest bad guy can be
        fun!

      <header id="personality">Personality</header>
      <p>
        Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are
        small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other
        character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting
        and fun about your character. They should be self descriptions that are
        specific about what makes your character stand out. “I’m sm art” is not
        a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. “I’ve read every
        book in Candlekeep” tells you something specific about your character’s
        interests and disposition. Personality traits might describe the things
        your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your
        character dislikes or fears, your character’s self attitude or mannerism
        s, or the influence o f his or her ability scores.
      </p>
      <p>To make it easy roll a d8 for your personality trait</p>

      <ul>
        <lt>d8 Personality Trait</lt>
        <li>1 I hide scraps of food and trinkets away in my pockets.</li>
        <li>2 I ask a lot of questions.</li>
        <li>
          3 I like to squeeze into small places where no one else can get to me.
        </li>
        <li>
          4 I sleep with my back to a wall or tree, with everything I own
          wrapped in a bundle in my arms.
        </li>
        <li>5 I eat like a pig and have bad manners.</li>
        <li>6 I think anyone who’s nice to me is hiding evil intent.</li>
        <li>7 I don’t like to bathe.</li>
        <li>8 I bluntly say what other people are hinting at or hiding</li>

    <section id="flaw" class="main-section">
      <header id="flaw">Flaw</header>
      <p>
        Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s flaw
        represents som e vice, com pulsion, fear, or w eakness—in particular,
        anything that som eone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause
        you to act against your best interests. M ore significant than negative
        personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: W hat
        enrages you? W hat’s the one person, concept, or event that you are
        terrified of? What are your vices?
      </p>
      <p>
        Choosing a flaw can seem hard. But it could be the most played aspect of
        your character. This could earn you Inspiration points.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <lt>d6 for Flaw</lt>
        <li>1 I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely</li>
        <li>
          2 I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple’s
          hierarchy.
        </li>
        <li>
          3 My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess
          faith in my god.
        </li>
        <li>4 I am inflexible in my thinking.</li>
        <li>5 I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.</li>
        <li>
          6 Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of
          everything else in my life.
